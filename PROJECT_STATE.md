# Project Purpose

amza-commercial-ai-platform is an AI-assisted commercial operations platform designed to help small and medium-sized businesses increase their sales capacity by combining Artificial Intelligence and human advisors into a single commercial workflow.

The platform is not a chatbot.

It is not a CRM replacement.

It is a Commercial Operations Platform where AI automates repetitive work while humans focus on high-value commercial activities.

The first implementation will be developed for **Amza Empaques**, but the platform is designed to become reusable for other companies with similar needs.

---

# Current Development Philosophy

The project follows four fundamental principles.

1. Business first.
2. Architecture before implementation.
3. Simplicity over unnecessary complexity.
4. Incremental development.

Every technical decision must support the business, never the opposite.

---

# Current Architecture

The platform is based on:

* Python 3.12
* FastAPI
* Hexagonal Architecture
* Domain Driven Design (lightweight)
* SQLAlchemy 2.x
* SQLite (MVP)
* PostgreSQL (future)
* Next.js 15
* TypeScript
* OpenRouter
* Telegram (MVP)
* WhatsApp Cloud API (future)

The system is built around **Opportunities**, not conversations.

An Opportunity represents the central business concept.

Conversations are only one part of an Opportunity.

# Current State

**What exists in the repository:**

* Complete project skeleton (backend + frontend + Docker + CI)
* FastAPI app initialized and running on port 8000
* Ruff + MyPy + pre-commit configured (46 source files passing clean)
* Vitest + Playwright configured
* Docker Compose working (backend:8000, frontend:3000)
* GitHub Actions CI configured
* Complete domain layer in `core/` (spec 002)
* Complete persistence layer in `infrastructure/database/` and `modules/*/models/` (spec 003)
* First Alembic migration applied — `data/amza.db` created with all 7 tables

**Persistence layer details (spec 003):**

* `infrastructure/database/base.py` — `DeclarativeBase`
* `infrastructure/database/engine.py` — `AsyncEngine` (sqlite+aiosqlite URL transform)
* `infrastructure/database/session.py` — `AsyncSessionFactory` + `get_session()` dependency
* `modules/configuration/models/organization.py` — `OrganizationModel`
* `modules/opportunities/models/contact.py` — `ContactModel` (unique: external_id + channel_type + org)
* `modules/opportunities/models/opportunity.py` — `OpportunityModel`
* `modules/opportunities/models/conversation.py` — `ConversationModel`
* `modules/opportunities/models/message.py` — `MessageModel` (campo: `extra_metadata` → columna DB: `metadata`)
* `modules/users/models/internal_user.py` — `InternalUserModel`
* `modules/agents/models/agent.py` — `AgentModel`
* `migrations/versions/0001_initial_schema.py` — aplicada con `alembic upgrade head`

**What does NOT exist yet:**

* Repository implementations (adaptadores de infraestructura para los Protocols de `core/interfaces/`)
* Application services / use cases
* API endpoints (FastAPI routers)
* Frontend pages con lógica de negocio

# Next Step

**Escribir e implementar `specifications/MVP/004_...`**

El siguiente spec lógico según la arquitectura hexagonal es **004 Repository Implementations** — implementar los adaptadores SQLAlchemy que satisfacen los Protocols definidos en `core/interfaces/repositories.py`.

Esto incluye:
- `SQLAlchemyOpportunityRepository`
- `SQLAlchemyContactRepository`
- `SQLAlchemyConversationRepository`
- `SQLAlchemyMessageRepository`
- `SQLAlchemyOrganizationRepository`
- `SQLAlchemyAgentRepository`
- `SQLAlchemyInternalUserRepository`
- `SQLAlchemyUnitOfWork`

# Working Methodology

Each specification represents one implementation milestone.

The workflow is always:

1. Read `PROJECT_STATE.md` and `IMPLEMENTATION_ORDER.md`.
2. Read the current specification.
3. Implement only that specification.
4. Validate (run lint, type check, tests).
5. Commit.
6. Update `PROJECT_STATE.md`.
7. Continue with the next specification.

Never implement multiple specifications simultaneously.

Never write code not covered by the current specification.

# Naming Decisions

Repository:

amza-commercial-ai-platform

Python package:

amza-commercial-ai-platform

Conda environment:

amza-commercial-ai-platform (Python 3.12.13)

Architecture:

Hexagonal

Main Business Entity:

Opportunity

Primary communication model:

Hybrid AI + Human

---

# Channels

Current implementation:

Telegram

Future implementations:

* WhatsApp Cloud API
* Instagram
* Facebook Messenger

Telegram exists only as the initial development adapter.

The platform itself is channel-independent.

---

# AI Philosophy

Artificial Intelligence is an assistant.

It is not the product.

It should automate repetitive work and transfer conversations to human advisors whenever business judgment is required.

The customer should never notice when the conversation changes between AI and a human.

---

# Frozen Decisions

These decisions must not be changed during the MVP without explicit approval.

Architecture:
✅ Hexagonal (Ports and Adapters)
